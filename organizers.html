    <h3>Organizing Committee</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dina Kanaan</strong> – University of Toronto</li>
      <p>Dina Kanaan is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of 
        Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. 
        Her research focuses on human-automation interaction in complex, safety-critical domains,
         including transportation and healthcare.</p>
      <li><strong>Suzan Ayas</strong> – University of Toronto</li>
            <p>Suzan Ayas is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of 
                Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto.
                 Her research combines data science and human factors, with a focus on 
                 developing in-vehicle systems to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness.</p>
      <li><strong>Mattea Powell</strong> – University of Toronto</li>
            <p>Mattea Powell is a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and 
                Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her research is on 
                driver hazard perception at the intersection of human factors engineering and psychology.</p>
      <li><strong>Birsen Donmez</strong> – University of Toronto</li>
            <p>Birsen Donmez is a Professor at the University of Toronto, Department of 
                Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, and the NSERC Canada Research Chair 
                in Human Factors and Transportation. Her research focuses on understanding and
                 improving human behavior and performance in multi-task and complex situations, 
                 with applications in surface transportation and healthcare. Among other roles, Donmez 
                 is a steering committee member of the ACM AutoUI Conference and served as the conference’s General Chair in 2018.</p>
      <li><strong>Greg A. Jamieson</strong> – University of Toronto</li>
            <p>Greg A. Jamieson is Professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at 
                the University of Toronto. His research and teaching center on the design of
                 cognitive artifacts for people working in complex systems. Professor Jamieson 
                 specializes in human-automation interaction and human-machine interface design with 
                 applications in process systems.</p>
