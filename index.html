    <h2>About This Workshop</h2>
    <p>Knowledge synthesis follows a transparent and reproducible set of procedures that systematically search and screen 
      the literature and extract relevant data to answer a research question. In systematic reviews or meta-analyses, 
      researchers need to critically evaluate potential biases (e.g., selection bias) that may influence the findings of 
      included studies. This appraisal is typically conducted using risk-of-bias assessment tools; however, the existing 
      tools are borrowed from healthcare research. This limits their usability and utility in transportation human factors (HF) 
      and user interface (UI) research. Given the increasing interest in systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the field, tools 
      that can facilitate transparent, reproducible, and thorough assessment of risk-of-bias are urgently needed to ensure rigor
      in evidence synthesis. Through group discussions and hands-on activities, this workshop will emphasize why risk-of-bias 
      assessment tools tailored for transportation HF and UI research are needed and design and evaluate a prototype tool on example
      HF studies.</p>

    <h3>Date & Location</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 22, 2025<br>
       <strong>Location:</strong> TBD</p>

    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p>This workshop is aimed at gathering expert opinions and feedback to inform the design of a risk-of-bias assessment tool to 
      support SR/MAs in transportation HF. Developing such a tool can advance our discipline by ensuring rigor in evidence synthesis 
      and better position our field to leverage knowledge synthesis methods for informing design and policymaking around transportation 
      and vehicle technology. The objectives of this workshop are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>highlight the importance of risk-of-bias assessment in advancing HF/UI research in transportation</li>
      <li>demonstrate that the risk-of-bias assessment tools created for healthcare research are not directly applicable to transportation studies,
        necessitating the development of more suitable tools for knowledge synthesis and evidence-based policymaking in transportation</li>
      <li>develop a prototype risk-of-bias assessment tool for transportation HF/UI research in a collaborative manner</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
    <p>The workshop will include a mix of presentations, group discussions, and hands-on activities. The tentative schedule is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introductions</li>
      <li>Mini-Lecture 1: Overview of SR/MAs and Study Biases</li>
      <li>Group Activity 1: Identifying Study Biases in Transportation HF/UI Research </li>
      <li>Mini-Lecture 2: Learning from Healthcare â€“ Common Risk-of-Bias Assessment Tools</li>
      <li>Group Activity 2: Applying Healthcare-based Tools to Transportation</li>
      <li>Group Activity 3: Adapting from Healthcare to Transportation</li>
      <li>Workshop Activity: Open Discussion</li>
      <li>Wrap-up and Next Steps</li>
    </ul>
